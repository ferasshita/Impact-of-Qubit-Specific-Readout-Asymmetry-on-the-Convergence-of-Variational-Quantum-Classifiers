# Comparative Analysis of Asymmetric Readout Errors on Variational Quantum Classifiers: Scaling from 2 to 4 Qubits

This repository contains the code and datasets for the study titled **"Comparative Analysis of Asymmetric Readout Errors on Variational Quantum Classifiers: Scaling from 2 to 4 Qubits"**.

## Project Overview
This research investigates how asymmetric readout errors impact the convergence and performance of Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC). We provide a comparative analysis as the system scales from 2 to 4 qubits, utilizing Google Colab for the experimental environment.

## Repository Contents
* `notebooks/`: Contains the Google Colab notebooks (`.ipynb`) used for the experiments.
* `data/`: Raw output data, CSV files, or results generated during the quantum simulations.
* `results/`: Plots and figures demonstrating the convergence and error analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
The experiments are designed to run in **Google Colab**. You will need:
* A Google account.
* Basic libraries: `qiskit qiskit-aer qiskit-algorithms numpy matplotlib scipy`

### Running the Experiments
1. Open the `.ipynb` file located in the `notebooks/` folder.
2. upload the file directly to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the asymmetric readout error simulations and VQC training.

## Data Availability
The datasets generated and analyzed during this study are included within the provided notebooks and output files in this repository.
